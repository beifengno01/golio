GoLio: Go! Lisp in OCaml
========================

GoLio is a Lisp dialect implemented in OCaml. The syntax, semantics and library procedures are a subset of R5RS, with one important addition: a Go-like concurrency model.

Currently, GoLio is mainly for me to learn the beautiful programming language OCaml while exploring lisp interpreter implementation and concurrent programming.

GoLio is my very first OCaml project. It is currently in a very alpha state and under heavy development. I learned so much from writing and polishing it and had so much fun.
