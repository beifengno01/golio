* later
    * add `golio_test.ml`...
    * refactor quasiquote
    * A global symbol table (using Weak)
    * ocamldoc
    * better exception: where the error is at
    * user-defined macro
    * more complete and compliant stdlib and tests
        * more I/O functions
        * `eval`
        * `delay` and `force`
        * vector
